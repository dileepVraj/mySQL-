To create table in database first activate the database in which we want to create a table by using 'use databaseName'
after activating the database, use 'create table tableName' command.

While creating a table we have to define at least one column because columns in table are building blocks where they
are useful in data organization, data integrity, data manipulation and retrieval, indexing and optimization.

syntax:- create table tableName
(column1 datatype(limit));
