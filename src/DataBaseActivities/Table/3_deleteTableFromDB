To delete a table from database we have two options, 'drop' and 'truncate' options.

1. DROP: when we use 'drop table tableName' it will delete the table along with it's structure(i.e columns,rows etc..)
In most of mySQL versions the DROP table command in not directly rollback-able with in a transaction.

2. TRUNCATE: When we use 'truncate table tableName' command it will deletes all the data associated with table but the
structure of the table will be intact.

Truncate table is also not a directly rollback-able transaction.
