Here are subsets of SQL which serves specific purposes.
========================================================================================================================
1. Data definition language:

In sql data definition language(DDL) is a subset of sql statements used to define and manage structure of database.
Data Definition Language statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as
tables, indexes, views, and constraints.

The primary purpose of Data Definition Language is to define schema or structure of the database.

Commonly used Data Definition Language statements:

I. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as table, views, indexes, and constraints.
    For example CREATE TABLE TABLE-NAME will create new table in database.

II. The ALTER statement is used to modify the existing object of a database.
    It can be used to add, delete, modify the columns, constraints, and indexes.

III. The DROP statement is used to delete a existing object in a database, such as table, view, index or schema.
    It permanently removes the object and associated data in database.

IV. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data excluding structure of object in a database.
    It is a fast way to delete all records in a table.

V. RENAME: The RENAME statement is used to rename existing object of a database such as table, or column.

Data Definition Language statements typically executed by administrators or users with appropriate privileges to manage
database structure.
They are crucial for setting up initial schema of a database, modifying it as needed, and managing overall structure
and organization of data.

2. Data Manipulation Language(DML):

   In mySQL Data Manipulation Language refers to subset of SQL statements used to retrieve, insert, modify, and delete
   data within tables in database.
   Data Manipulation Language focuses on modifying the existing data in the table rather than modifying the structure
   of the database.

   Key Data Manipulation Language statements:
   -----------------------------------------

 I. SELECT: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified conditions.
    It allows us to query the database and retrieve specific data.

 II. INSERT: INSERT statement is used to insert rows into a table, specifying column values for each inserted row.

 III. UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to update the existing data in the table. It allows us to update specific
      columns in one or more rows with specified conditions.

 IV. MERGE: The MERGE statement is used to perform insert, update, or delete operation on a target table based on results
 of join with a source table.
========================================================================================================================

3. Data Control Language(DCL):

   In mySQl Data Control Language statements are used to manage user privileges, access controls, and security with in
   database.
   Data Control Statements allow database administrators to control and regulate user permissions or revoking privileges
   on database objects.

    Key statements in Data Control Language:
    ---------------------------------------
I. GRANT: The GRANT statement is used to give specific privileges to users in database. Privileges include ability to
select, create, update, delete or manage database objects.

II. REVOKE: The REVOKE statement is used to revoke or remove previously granted privileges from users in database.
    It can revoke specific privileges or all privileges granted to user.

III. ALTER USER: The ALTER USER statement is used to modify the existing user privileges in database.

IV.  DROP USER: The DROP USER statement is used to remove existing user account from database.

V.  CREATE USER: The CREATE USER statement is used to create a new user in database. It includes specifying username,
    password, and other authentication details.

========================================================================================================================
4. Transaction Control Language(TCL):

    Transaction Control Language is used to manage transactions with in a database. Transaction Control language statements
    are used/responsible for managing the beginning, ending, and intermediate states of transactions to maintain data
    integrity and data consistency.

    The primary statements of Transaction Control Language:
    ------------------------------------------------------

I. START TRANSACTION: This statement is used to explicitly begin a new transaction. It marks starting point of a transaction
    and allows you to group multiple sql statements into a logical unit or work.

II. COMMIT: The COMMIT statement is used to save changes made during the transaction. It confirms successful completion
    a transaction and save the changes permanently in the database.

III. ROLLBACK: The ROLLBACK statement is used to undo the changes made during the transaction and brings back the data
    to its original state before transaction begins.
    It cancels the transaction and ensures that no changes are applied to the database.

IV. SAVEPOINT: The SAVEPOINT is used to create a named points within a transaction to provide more granular control over
    the rollbacks. You can define a SAVEPOINT at various stages of transaction and can rollback to that specific point
    without rollback to the entire transaction.

V.  RELEASE SAVEPOINT: The RELEASE SAVEPOINT is used to remove a previously defined SAVEPOINT. It frees up system resources
    associated with that SAVEPOINT without affecting changes made to that SAVEPOINT.

VI. ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT: The ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT is used to undo changes made in the transaction until specified SAVEPOINT.
    It allows you to selectively rollback to particular SAVEPOINT with in transaction.
