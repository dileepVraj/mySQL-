SQL supports several data types that define the kind of data that can be stored in database tables or used in SQL
statements. The specific data types available may vary slightly between different database management systems (DBMS),
but here are some commonly used data types in SQL:

Numeric Types:

INTEGER: Represents whole numbers (e.g., 1, 10, -5).
FLOAT/REAL: Represents floating-point numbers with decimal precision (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
DECIMAL/NUMERIC: Represents fixed-point numbers with decimal precision (e.g., 3.1415, -123.45).
Character/String Types:

CHAR(n): Represents fixed-length strings with a specified maximum length (e.g., 'hello' with n=5).
VARCHAR(n): Represents variable-length strings with a maximum length (e.g., 'hello' with n=5).
TEXT: Represents variable-length strings without a specified maximum length (used for large text blocks).
Date and Time Types:

DATE: Represents a date (e.g., '2023-06-07').
TIME: Represents a time of day (e.g., '12:34:56').
TIMESTAMP/DATETIME: Represents a combination of date and time (e.g., '2023-06-07 12:34:56').
Boolean Type:

BOOLEAN: Represents a logical value, typically true or false.
Binary Types:

BINARY: Represents fixed-length binary data.
VARBINARY: Represents variable-length binary data.
BLOB: Represents large binary objects (used for storing images, documents, etc.).
Other Types:

ENUM: Represents a predefined set of values.
JSON: Represents JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.
XML: Represents XML (Extensible Markup Language) data.
It's worth noting that different DBMS may provide additional data types specific to their implementation or have
variations in the naming and behavior of certain data types. It's essential to refer to the documentation of the
specific database system you are using for a comprehensive list of supported data types and their properties.
