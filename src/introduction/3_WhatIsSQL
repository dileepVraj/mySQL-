SQL stands for 'structured query language' it is a programming language designed for storing and manipulating data in
relational database management systems.
It provides a standard way of interacting databases, allowing users to store, retrieve, update and delete data.

SQL is declarative language means that user specify what data they want to retrieve or modify without specifying how to
do it.
The Database Management System interprets the queries and determines most effective way to execute them.

Some common tasks performed using SQL are:

Retrieving data, Modifying data, Creating and altering database structure, Managing database objects.

Retrieving data: SQL allows us to retrieve data from one or more tables using queries. You can specify conditions, sort
the results, and limit the number of records returned.

Modifying data: SQL provides commands to create new records, update existing records, and delete records from database
table.

Creating and altering database structure: SQL enables us to create new tables, define their structure(columns, data types,
constraints), and modifying existing tables (add or remove columns, change data types).

Managing database objects: SQL allows you to create and manage database objects like, Views, Indexes, Stored procedures,
Functions, and Triggers.

SQL is widely used programming language that is used to interact with relational database management systems, including
popular one ORACLE, MYSQL, PostgresSQL, and SQLite. Its syntax and functionality may vary slightly across different
database systems, but the core concepts and principles remain same.
